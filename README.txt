This library contains a series of files showing how experiments were prepared, run and evaluated

1. Dictonary Generation
  - appends thr results of various physics based models into the FreeSolv dataset
2. Partitioning
  - demonstrates how the daataset was partitioned in such a way that each partition represents an even distribution of the whole dataset
3. Error Prediction
  - a simple experiment predicting the residuals of a physics model and correcting the values
4. K-fold Cross Validation
  - using k-fold cross validation to run multiple experiments and gain a more general understanding of the models preformance on the dataset
5. Hyperparameter Exploration
  - running many cross validation experiments on the validation set to find the best combination of hyperparameters
  - manually edit parameter list selection and destination directory
6. Hyperparameter Evaluation
  - train and store models on final hyperparameters
7. Graphing
  -
